//variables-containers that store values

var myVariable // declared, but not initialized..it has no value
// also, don't use "var" anymore. ES6 teaches us about "let and "const" 

let thisVariable = 'blake' // declared and initialized

const ANSWER = 42 // unchangeable 

//STRING

let string1 = 'Hello World'

let string2 = new String('Hello world') // look up difference between string literals and using a constructor. 

//NUMBER    

let thisNumb = 3.14159

//Boolean

let thisBool = true

let minArray = ['value'] //Array uses square brackets

let my Array = [42, 'bob', thisBool, false] // array hold most anything

// Object

let minimalObject = {}
